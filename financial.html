              <p class="card-text">
                Microsoft's focus on high-margin products and services, coupled with efficent cost management, has led to significant profitability. In recent years, the company has achieved an average annual growth in profitability of approximately 15%-20%.

While specific percentage growth figures for debt levels may vary, Microsoft's debt-to-equity ratio has remained stable or even decreased slightly over time. This indicates the company's ability to finance its growth initiatives without overly relying on debt, thus mitigating financial risk for investors.
